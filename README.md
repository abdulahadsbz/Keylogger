# Keylogger  

## To start the keylogger  
- download the files  
- extract from Keylogger.7z
- double click either the Keylogger.py or Keylogger.exe  

## Other info  

### How it works
it creates a log.txt and puts all keylogs in it along with the time they were pressed and which window was active when they were pressed the pynput module was mainly used for this

### Is it a virus
dont worry it is not a virus it wont send me your key strokes or anything like that i only made this for fun if you are still not sure you can open a text editor and see the code yourself

### does it run in the background
No but you can make it run in the background by making it a .pyw file instead

### should i run the exe or py(w) file
allthough keylogger.exe works (Atleast on windows) i still suggest you run Keylogger.py(w) becuase they is more stable
