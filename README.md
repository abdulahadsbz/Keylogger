# Keylogger  

## To start the keylogger  
- download the files  
- unzip Keylogger.7z
- double click either the Keylogger.py or Keylogger.py  

## Other info  

### How it works
it creates a log.txt and puts all keylogs in it along with the time they were pressed and which window was active when they were pressed  

### Is it a virus
dont worry it is not a virus it wont send me your key strokes or anything like that i only made this for fun if you are still not sure you can open a text editor and see the code yourself

### does it run in the background
No but you can make it run in the background by making it a .pyw file instead

### should i run the exe or py(w) file
allthough keylogger.exe works (Atleast on windows) i still suggest you run Keylogger.py becuase it is more stable

- Dont claim it as your own

other then that feel free to use it
